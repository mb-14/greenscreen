# Multi-Hand Tracking (GPU)

This doc focuses on the
[example graph](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/tree/master/mediapipe/graphs/hand_tracking/multi_hand_tracking_mobile.pbtxt)
that performs multi-hand tracking with TensorFlow Lite on GPU. It is related to
the [hand_tracking_example](./hand_tracking_mobile_gpu.md), and we recommend
users to review the (single) hand tracking example first.

![multi_hand_tracking_android_gpu.gif](images/mobile/multi_hand_tracking_android_gpu.gif)

In the visualization above, the red dots represent the hand landmarks and the
green lines are simply connections between selected landmark paris for
visualization of the hand skeleton. When there are fewer than `N` hands (`N=2`
in the graphs here), the purple box represents a hand rectangle that covers the
entire hand, derived from hand detection (see
[hand_detection_example](./hand_detection_mobile_gpu.md)). When there are `N`
hands (i.e. 2 hands for the graphs here), the red boxes represent hand
rectangles for each of the hands, derived from the previous round of hand
landmark localization using an ML model (see also
[model card](https://mediapipe.page.link/handmc)). Hand landmark localization
for each hand is performed only within the hand rectangle for computational
efficiency and accuracy. Hand detection is only invoked whenever there are fewer
than `N` hands in the previous iteration.

This example can also run a model that localizes hand landmarks in 3D (i.e.,
estimating an extra z coordinate):

![multi_hand_tracking_3d_android_gpu.gif](images/mobile/multi_hand_tracking_3d_android_gpu.gif)

In the visualization above, the localized hand landmarks are represented by dots
in different shades, with the brighter ones denoting landmarks closer to the
camera.

## Android

[Source](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/tree/master/mediapipe/examples/android/src/java/com/google/mediapipe/apps/multihandtrackinggpu)

To build the app yourself, run:

```bash
bazel build -c opt --config=android_arm64 mediapipe/examples/android/src/java/com/google/mediapipe/apps/multihandtrackinggpu
```

To build for the 3D mode, run:

```bash
bazel build -c opt --config=android_arm64 --define 3D=true mediapipe/examples/android/src/java/com/google/mediapipe/apps/multihandtrackinggpu
```

Once the app is built, install it on Android device with:

```bash
adb install bazel-bin/mediapipe/examples/android/src/java/com/google/mediapipe/apps/multihandtrackinggpu/multihandtrackinggpu.apk
```

## iOS

[Source](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/tree/master/mediapipe/examples/ios/multihandtrackinggpu).

See the general [instructions](./mediapipe_ios_setup.md) for building iOS
examples and generating an Xcode project. This will be the HandDetectionGpuApp
target.

To build on the command line:

```bash
bazel build -c opt --config=ios_arm64 mediapipe/examples/ios/multihandtrackinggpu:MultiHandTrackingGpuApp
```

To build for the 3D mode, run:

```bash
bazel build -c opt --config=ios_arm64 --define 3D=true mediapipe/examples/ios/multihandtrackinggpu:MultiHandTrackingGpuApp
```

## Graph

The multi-hand tracking [main graph](#main-graph) internal utilizes a
[multi_hand_detection_subgraph](#multi-hand-detection-subgraph), a
[multi_hand_landmark_subgraph](#multi-hand-landmark-subgraph), and a
[multi_hand_renderer_subgraph](#multi-hand-renderer-subgraph).

The subgraphs show up in the main graph visualization as nodes colored in
purple, and the subgraph itself can also be visualized just like a regular
graph. For more information on how to visualize a graph that includes subgraphs,
see the Visualizing Subgraphs section in the
[visualizer documentation](./visualizer.md).

### Main Graph

![multi_hand_tracking_mobile_graph](images/mobile/multi_hand_tracking_mobile.png)

There are two key differences between this graph and the
[single_hand_tracking_mobile_graph](./hand_tracking_mobile_gpu.md).

1.  There is a `NormalizedRectVectorHasMinSize` calculator, that checks if in
    input vector of `NormalizedRect` objects has a minimum size equal to `N`. In
    this graph, if the vector contains fewer than `N` objects,
    `MultiHandDetection` subgraph runs. Otherwise, the `GateCalculator` doesn't
    send any image packets to the `MultiHandDetection` subgraph. This way, the
    main graph is efficient in that it avoids running the costly hand detection
    step when there are already `N` hands in the frame.
2.  The `MergeCalculator` has been replaced by the `AssociationNormRect`
    calculator. This `AssociationNormRect` takes as input a vector of
    `NormalizedRect` objects from the `MultiHandDetection` subgraph on the
    current frame, and a vector of `NormalizedRect` objects from the
    `MultiHandLandmark` subgraph from the previous frame, and performs an
    association operation between these objects. This calculator ensures that
    the output vector doesn't contain overlapping regions based on the specified
    `min_similarity_threshold`.

### Multi-Hand Detection Subgraph

![multi_hand_detection_gpu_subgraph](images/mobile/multi_hand_detection_gpu_subgraph.png)

This graph outputs a vector of `NormalizedRect` objects corresponding to each of
the hand instances visible in the frame. Note that at the end of this graph,
there is a `ClipNormalizedRectVectorSizeCalculator`. This calculator clips the
size of the input vector to a maximum size `N`. This implies that the
`MultiHandDetection` subgraph outputs a vector of maximum `N` hand instance
locations.

### Multi-Hand Landmark Subgraph

![multi_hand_landmark_subgraph.pbtxt](images/mobile/multi_hand_landmark_subgraph.png)

This graph accepts as input a vector of `NormalizedRect` objects, corresponding
the the region of each hand instance in the input image. For each
`NormalizedRect` object, the graph runs the existing `HandLandmark` subgraph and
collect the outputs of this subgraph into vectors. This is enabled by
`BeginLoop` and `EndLoop` calculators.

The `BeginLoop` calculator accepts as input a packet containing an iterable
collection of elements. This calculator is templatized (see
[begin_loop_calculator.h](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/tree/master/mediapipe/calculators/core/begin_loop_calculator.h)).
If the input packet arrived at a timestamp `ts`, this calculator outputs each
element in the collection at a fake timestamp `internal_ts`. At the end of the
collection, the calculator outputs the arrival timestamp `ts` in the output
stream tagged with `BATCH_END`.

The nodes between the `BeginLoop` calculator and the corresponding `EndLoop`
calculator process individual packets at the fake timestamps `internal_ts`.
After each element is processed, it is sent to the `EndLoop` calculator (see
[end_loop_calculator.h](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/tree/master/mediapipe/calculators/core/end_loop_calculator.h)),
which collects these elements in an output collection. The `EndLoop` calculator
listens for packets from the `BATCH_END` output stream of the `BeginLoop`
calculator. When the `BATCH_END` packet containing the real timestamp `ts`
arrives at the `EndLoop` calculator, the `EndLoop` calculator outputs a packet
containing the collection of processed elements at the real timestamp `ts`.

In the multi-hand landmark subgraph, the `EndLoop` calculators collect the
output vector of hand landmarks per hand instance, the boolean values indicating
the presence of each hand and the `NormalizedRect` objects corresponding to the
regions surrounding each hand into vectors.

Finally, based on the hand presence boolean value, the graph filters the
collections of hand landmarks and `NormalizdRect` objects corresponding to each
hand instance.
