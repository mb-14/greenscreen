## Hand Tracking on Desktop

This is an example of using MediaPipe to run hand tracking models (TensorFlow
Lite) and render bounding boxes on the detected hand (one hand only). To know
more about the hand tracking models, please refer to the model [`README file`].
Moreover, if you are interested in running the same TensorfFlow Lite model on
Android/iOS, please see the
[Hand Tracking on GPU on Android/iOS](hand_tracking_mobile_gpu.md) and

We show the hand tracking demos with TensorFlow Lite model using the Webcam:

-   [TensorFlow Lite Hand Tracking Demo with Webcam (CPU)](#tensorflow-lite-hand-tracking-demo-with-webcam-cpu)

-   [TensorFlow Lite Hand Tracking Demo with Webcam (GPU)](#tensorflow-lite-hand-tracking-demo-with-webcam-gpu)

Note: Desktop GPU works only on Linux. Mesa drivers need to be installed. Please
see
[step 4 of "Installing on Debian and Ubuntu" in the installation guide](./install.md).

Note: If MediaPipe depends on OpenCV 2, please see the
[known issues with OpenCV 2](./object_detection_desktop.md#known-issues-with-opencv-2)
section.

### TensorFlow Lite Hand Tracking Demo with Webcam (CPU)

To build and run the TensorFlow Lite example on desktop (CPU) with Webcam, run:

```bash
# Video from webcam running on desktop CPU
$ bazel build -c opt --define MEDIAPIPE_DISABLE_GPU=1 \
    mediapipe/examples/desktop/hand_tracking:hand_tracking_cpu

# It should print:
#Target //mediapipe/examples/desktop/hand_tracking:hand_tracking_cpu up-to-date:
#  bazel-bin/mediapipe/examples/desktop/hand_tracking/hand_tracking_cpu
#INFO: Build completed successfully, 12517 total actions

# This will open up your webcam as long as it is connected and on
# Any errors is likely due to your webcam being not accessible
$ GLOG_logtostderr=1 bazel-bin/mediapipe/examples/desktop/hand_tracking/hand_tracking_cpu \
    --calculator_graph_config_file=mediapipe/graphs/hand_tracking/hand_tracking_desktop_live.pbtxt
```

### TensorFlow Lite Hand Tracking Demo with Webcam (GPU)

To build and run the TensorFlow Lite example on desktop (GPU) with Webcam, run:

```bash
# Video from webcam running on desktop GPU
# This works only for linux currently
$ bazel build -c opt --copt -DMESA_EGL_NO_X11_HEADERS --copt -DEGL_NO_X11 \
    mediapipe/examples/desktop/hand_tracking:hand_tracking_gpu

# It should print:
# Target //mediapipe/examples/desktop/hand_tracking:hand_tracking_gpu up-to-date:
#  bazel-bin/mediapipe/examples/desktop/hand_tracking/hand_tracking_gpu
#INFO: Build completed successfully, 22455 total actions

# This will open up your webcam as long as it is connected and on
# Any errors is likely due to your webcam being not accessible,
# or GPU drivers not setup properly.
$ GLOG_logtostderr=1 bazel-bin/mediapipe/examples/desktop/hand_tracking/hand_tracking_gpu \

#### Graph

To visualize the graph as shown above, copy the text specification of the graph
below and paste it into
[MediaPipe Visualizer](https://viz.mediapipe.dev).
